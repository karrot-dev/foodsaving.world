Make a clear statement and don't let people assume that you are bunch of cheap garbage-hungry humans. What you are doing is amazing and you know it! <br>\n\nThe fact that your community exists already gets a lot of attention and raises awareness. Don't be shy! Get people to talk about it; share food, love and awareness!"
