      description: "<h3>Let's get organized!</h3>\n\n<p>The core piece of our work is a tool, that is meant to enable you to run a successful, efficient and organized foodsaving project. It is a <strong>completely translatable, open source and free</strong> piece of software, that is developed by passionate volunteers only. </p>\n\n<p>We host an instance of it right here on foodsaving.world and you can try it out as much as you like. The general idea for long-term use however is, that foodsaving groups host their own instances if possible. </p>\n\n<p><i>You're very welcome to <a href=https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend>visit our project on GitHub</a> if you want to have a closer look at the code.</i></p>\n\n<p>These are just some of the benefits you'll experience when deciding to use Karrot for your foodsaving group:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Less confusion</strong><br> All the relevant info of a store can be entered on the store page. General group info can be entered on the group page and every single foodsaver has a profile, in which info can be entered.</li>\n<li><strong>More overview</strong><br> You have a map of where the stores and the people doing the pick-ups are located. You have a nice list of upcoming pick-ups and can sign up for them online.</li>\n<li><strong>Record of past events</strong><br> The history shows who did what and when. If a pick-up was missed you can see who to yell at... ;)</li>\n<li>Karrot is <strong>fully translatable</strong> by the community and many languages are already added. To contribute more translations just <a href=\"https://www.transifex.com/yunity-1/karrot/\" target=\"_blank\">visit the project on transifex</a>.</li>\n<li>Since Karrot is <strong>open source</strong> we encourage groups to host their own instances of the platform, if they have the ability to do so. Still, we also provide access to a hosted version here on foodsaving.world.\n\n<div align=\"center\"><p><a href=\"https://karrot.world\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button\">Try Karrot now!</a></p></div>"
