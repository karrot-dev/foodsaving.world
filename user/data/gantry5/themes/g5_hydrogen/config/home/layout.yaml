They collected a lot of wisdom about\n    how to successfully cooperate with businesses to save their surplus, how to distribute it afterwards and how to maintain\n    a well-functioning group of volunteers. Apart from that, we are in contact with many other foodsaving initiatives and\n    many shared their work and insights with us and thus with you.
