        <div align="left">
        <p>When a foodsaving group is growing, it becomes hard to keep all members in sync. They start using group chats, spreadsheets and other online tools. At some point, this isn't enough anymore and specialized software becomes crucial for their operations. We aim to build this software and connect similar-minded projects!</p>

        <li><strong><a href="https://foodsharing.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foodsharing.de</a></strong> aims at German-speaking groups, it's foodsaving organizer and a social network at the same time</li>

They collected a lot of wisdom about\n    how to successfully cooperate with businesses to save their surplus, how to distribute it afterwards and how to maintain\n    a well-functioning group of volunteers. Apart from that, we are in contact with many other foodsaving initiatives and\n    many shared their work and insights with us and thus with you. Using this as a base, we created a collection of documents,\n    which hopefully proves useful:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Directly on this site there is the guide on\n        <strong>\n          <a href=\"../startcommunity\">how to start a foodsaving initiative</a>\n        </strong>.</li>\n      <li>We put together a\n        <strong>\n          <a href=\"https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSINT/pages/50069535/Material+to+get+started\" target=\"_blank\">library of howtos, manuals and template documents</a>\n        </strong> for groups, that are just starting.
