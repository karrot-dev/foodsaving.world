### Let's get organized!
When you want to run a foodsaving initiative that scales, you'll need some kind of management system. Having an online platform was one of the major factors for German foodsharing to become so big.

Specifically for foodsaving groups we started developing Karrot to provide you with the features you need:

* **Less confusion** <br> All the relevant info is accessible in one place and the foodsavers know how to contact each other. Everyone knows who is supposed to do which pick-up.

* **More overview** <br> You know where the stores and the people doing the pick-ups are located. You have a nice list of upcoming pick-ups and can sign up for them online.

* **Record of past events** <br> The history shows who did what and when. If a pick-up was missed you can see who to yell at... ;)
