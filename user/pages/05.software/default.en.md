### Let's get organized!
When you want to run a foodsaving initiative that scales, you'll need some kind of management system. Having an online platform was one of the major factors for German foodsharing to become so big.

Specifically for foodsaving groups we started developing Karrot to provide you with the features you need:

* **Less confusion** <br> All the relevant info of a store can be entered on the store page. General group info can be entered on the group page and every single foodsaver has a profile, in which info can be entered.

* **More overview** <br> You have a map of where the stores and the people doing the pick-ups are located. You have a nice list of upcoming pick-ups and can sign up for them online.

* **Record of past events** <br> The history shows who did what and when. If a pick-up was missed you can see who to yell at... ;)

* Karrot is **fully translatable** by the community and many languages are already added. To contribute more translations just <a href="https://www.transifex.com/yunity-1/karrot/" target="_blank">visit the project on transifex</a>.

* Since Karrot is **open source** we encourage groups to host their own instances of the platform, if they have the ability to do so. Still, we also provide access to a hosted version here on foodsaving.world.
