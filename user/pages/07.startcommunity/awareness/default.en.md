# Raising Awareness

### <div class="fa fa-bullhorn"></div> _Promote the good cause_
Most importantly: _Don't use the "free of cost" incentive!_ <br>
Foodsaving isn't about promoting access to free food, it's about fighting a waste-system that we disagree with.<br>
Make a clear statement and don't let people assume that you are bunch of cheap garbage-hungry humans.<br>
What you are doing is amazing and you know it!

The fact that your community exists already gets a lot of attention and raises awareness. Don't be shy! Get people to talk about it; share food, love and awareness!

### <div class="fa fa-cutlery"></div> _Events that spark interest_
There are many possibilities to get people's interest up: Events like <a href="http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2015/03/01/eat-to-the-beat-disco-soup-are-turning-food-waste-into-party-fuel/" target="_blank">disco soups</a> or pop-up Food-Share Points, where saved food gets distributed to the people, always get a lot of attention. Or you make use of <a href="https://feedbackglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/F5K-The-Introductory-Toolkit-1.pdf" target="_blank">Feedback Global's toolkit</a> and organize a <a href="https://feedbackglobal.org/campaigns/feeding-the-5000/" target="_blank">Feeding the 5000</a> event. That's _definitely_ get you that press you need! And on top of that it's fun and a great opportunity to get to know more like-minded people!

### <div class="fa fa-institution"></div> _It's getting political_
You could also run an awareness rising campaign among politicians and other public players. <br>
For instance, over the course of 2015 and 2016 <a href="https://foodsharing.de" target="_blank">foodsharing.de</a> has actively participated in the <a href="http://www.leeretonne.de/" target="_blank">Leere Tonne</a> ("Empty bins") campaign, using a petition to ask the German government to adopt a similar law as the one voted for in the French Parliament in spring 2016, which forces supermarkets to donate their surplus food instead of throwing it away. <br>
Food waste is becoming a more and more prominent topic in public discourse, so there are already public programmes - like the European <a href="http://eu-refresh.org/" target="_blank">Refresh program</a> - , with which you could connect to support each other. <br>
Keep in mind though that, as far as political parties are concerned, foodsharing stays as neutral as possible.
