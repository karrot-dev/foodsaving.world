### Let's get organized!

_We develop free and open source software for you to organize your pick-ups!_

The core piece of our work is a tool, that is meant to enable you to run a successful, efficient and organized foodsaving project. It is a **completely translatable, open source and free** piece of software, that is developed by passionate volunteers only.

We host an instance of it on [karrot.world](https://karrot.world) and you can try it out as much as you like. The general idea for long-term use however is, that foodsaving groups host their own instances if possible.

_You're very welcome to [visit our project on GitHub](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend) if you want to have a closer look at the development process and code._

These are just some of the benefits you'll experience when deciding to use Karrot for your foodsaving group:

- **Less confusion**
  All the relevant info of a store can be entered on the store page. General group info can be entered on the group page and every single foodsaver has a profile, in which info can be entered.
- **More overview**
  You have a map of where the stores and the people doing the pick-ups are located. You have a nice list of upcoming pickups and can sign up for them online.
- **Record of past events**
  The history shows who did what and when. If a pickup was missed you can see who to yell at... ;)
- Karrot is **fully translatable**> by the community and many languages are already added. To contribute more translations just [visit the project on transifex](https://www.transifex.com/yunity-1/karrot/).
- Since Karrot is **open source** we encourage groups to host their own instances of the platform, if they have the ability to do so. Still, we also provide access to a hosted version on karrot.world.
