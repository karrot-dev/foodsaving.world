## History and affiliation

Do you wonder how this is connected to foodsharing in Germany, Austria and Switzerland? We compiled a [FAQ](../faq) to answer the most frequent questions.

[Click here](../history) to read about what we've been up to in 2017. (Sadly we didn't find the time so far to add more recent developments.)

A history that is more detailed but doesn't get updates anymore can be found in the legacy [yunity wiki](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/YUN/pages/4227494/1.+The+story+so+far). It tells of the origins of foodsaving worldwide in yunity and foodsharing.de.
