### Let's get organized!
The core piece of our work is a tool, that is meant to enable you to run a successful, efficient and organized foodsaving project. It is a <strong>completely translatable, open source and free</strong> piece of software, that is developed by passionate volunteers only. <br>
We host an instance of it right here on foodsaving.world and you can try it out as much as you like. The general idea for long-term use however is, that foodsaving groups host their own instances if possible. <br>
_You're very welcome to <a href=https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend>visit our project on GitHub</a> if you want to have a closer look at the code._</p>

These are just some of the benefits you'll experience when deciding to use Karrot for your foodsaving group:

* **Less confusion** <br> All the relevant info of a store can be entered on the store page. General group info can be entered on the group page and every single foodsaver has a profile, in which info can be entered.

* **More overview** <br> You have a map of where the stores and the people doing the pick-ups are located. You have a nice list of upcoming pick-ups and can sign up for them online.

* **Record of past events** <br> The history shows who did what and when. If a pick-up was missed you can see who to yell at... ;)

* Karrot is **fully translatable** by the community and many languages are already added. To contribute more translations just <a href="https://www.transifex.com/yunity-1/karrot/" target="_blank">visit the project on transifex</a>.

* Since Karrot is **open source** we encourage groups to host their own instances of the platform, if they have the ability to do so. Still, we also provide access to a hosted version here on foodsaving.world.
