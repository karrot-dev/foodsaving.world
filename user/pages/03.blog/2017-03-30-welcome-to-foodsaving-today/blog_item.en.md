Today we launch a new website! The purpose is to share news, information, announcements, events from round the world about foodsaving. To share and inspire.

If you don't know anything about foodsaving: the aim is to prevent food from going to waste (try [this introduction](
https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/free-food-sharing-leftovers-surplus-local-popular) from The Guardian).

There are many people and projects trying to solve this now, with many different approaches - non-profit or profit, software or not, open source or proprietary, formal or informal, custom software or a patchwork of tools, community or business.

That's all for now, but stay tuned...
