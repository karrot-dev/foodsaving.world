### Let's share experience!
The German speaking countries have a history of foodsaving that goes back to 2011. They collected a lot of wisdom about how to successfully cooperate with businesses to save their surplus, how to distribute it afterwards and how to maintain a well-functioning group of volunteers. Apart from that, we are in contact with many other foodsaving initiatives and many shared their work and insights with us and thus with you. Using this as a base, we created a collection of documents, which hopefully proves useful:

* Directly on this site there is the guide on **[how to start a foodsaving initiative](../startcommunity)**
* We put together a <strong><a href="https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSINT/pages/50069535/Material+to+get+started" target="_blank">library of howtos, manuals and template documents</a></strong> for groups, that are just starting. We did this for you, so please use everything in there however you see fit!
* We compiled a <strong><a href="https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSINT/pages/41812111/foodsharing+Wiki+for+International+Audiences" target="_blank">shortened, translated and adapted version of the German foodsharing wiki</a></strong>.<br>The German original can be found <a href="https://wiki.foodsharing.de/Hauptseite" target="_blank">here.</a>
* We run a <strong><a href="https://foodsaving.today" target="_blank">blog full of stories from foodsaving groups</a></strong>, where everybody can share their challenges and success. We are <a href="mailto:foodsaving@yunity.org" target="_blank">always hungry for more stories</a> (in any language) to include them on there!
