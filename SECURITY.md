## :warning: Versions

Versions with :warning: will be supported for security issues, however you won't be able to update to them, you will need to manually update through the [`direct-install` command](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/admin-panel/tools).

If you cannot update to the latest stable version available because, for example, your server does not meet the minimum PHP requirements, you can manually install a previous version by downloading the package from our Releases directory (https://github.com/getgrav/grav/releases).
